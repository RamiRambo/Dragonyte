    ❥ Verifying if there were no NaN values,
    
    ❥ Verying that dates were in a uniform format,
    
    ❥ Re-arranging dataframes after filtering for creating specific charts,
    
    ❥ Verifying unique values to cross-check values given in other csv files such as subcategories or locations,
    
    ❥ Transforming number characters into int or float types,
    
    ❥ Transposing location.csv,
